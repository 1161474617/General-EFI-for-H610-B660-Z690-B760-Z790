## Intel 2.5GbE

Supportï¼š

| Device       | Big Sur | Monterey (12.3) | Ventura |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Intel i225-V | No      | Yes             | Yes     |

You need to enable ***VT-d*** in BIOS and disable ***DisableIoMapper*** in OpenCore. That is enough.

> From macOS Monterey, Apple's native hardware requires VT-d to provide a DMA remapping strategy. And starting from Intel 600 series, it found that there is no *Reserved Memory Region* in DMAR, only *IOAPIC*. So to enable Intel 2.5GbE only need to enable *AppleVTD*.
